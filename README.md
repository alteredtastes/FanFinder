# NapRanks
Sample full stack app written with React, Express, Node, and Mongo. Demonstrates consumption of the Napster API with 3-Legged OAuth, authenticated API calls, isomorphic fetch, ES7's await and async functions, and JSON web tokens.  

Node 7.9.0  
- This app requires Node 7.9 or later due to ES7 async functions and await. To swap Node versions, I use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).  
`nvm install 7.9.0`  
`nvm use 7.9.0`
